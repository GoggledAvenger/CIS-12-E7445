I had a lot of trouble with Lab 5. Basically, the program doesn't work. I think I got most of the elements in there but they don't do what I think they should. 
I used PythonTutor to try to figure out where my recursions were going and that helped a lot, but in the end I still couldn't get is_valid_ip to work.
To top off a frustrating day of coding, GitHub would not connect with my home computer for many tries. 
I have a bit of a fever so I'll pretend that's why this didn't work out.
